-- Objectives

Pedagogical Project

1. Well-documented cross-platform code for reproducing your experimental evaluations. Julia, Python, R, and C++/C are acceptable.
  - Language: Python
2. Either include the data sets you used (if small enough), or provide a script that downloads and preprocesses them to the format that your code expects as input
  - Data set: Use pre-existing dataset from the paper (MAKE SURE TO CITE IT!!!!!)
              Potentially also try out using the Fashion dataset from HW2
3. A pdf slide deck for your 20 minute in-class presentation, using appropriately typeset math and legible figures that addresses all of the points below.
  - Google Slides: 
4. If your project is pedagogical, post the problem set here as well, clearly labeled.
  - Create answer key for problem set.
